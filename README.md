# Semester 4 E&B project: EDA on Default of Credit Card Payments
This repository performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing information about individuals who have defaulted on their credit card payments.

## Why does the problem exist?
In the early 2000s, the credit card issuers in Taiwan faced the cash and credit card debt crisis which gave to the rise in the delinquencies we shall be examining.
An increased overuse of credit cards, without repayment, for consumption accumulated hefty debts. This poses as an obstacle no bank would wanna hurdle over.
To assess and control the risk at hand, we devise a model to not only classify a customer as credible or not but to give the probability of default too.

## Overview of the Dataset:
An important bank in Taiwan conducted a study back in the year 2005, and their targets were the credit card holders of the bank. Among 30,000 recorded observations, 6,636 card holders were found to have defaulted on their payments.
 

## Predicting what?
We employ an artificial neural network to predict the probability of default on credit card payments.

The dataset has been taken from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository website
