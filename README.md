# Semester 4 E&B project: EDA on Default of Credit Card Payments
This repository performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing information about individuals who have defaulted on their credit card payments.

## Why does the problem exist?
In the early 2000s, the credit card issuers in Taiwan faced the cash and credit card debt crisis which gave to the rise in the delinquencies we shall be examining.
An increased overuse of credit cards, without repayment, for consumption of commodities accumulated hefty debts. This poses as an obstacle no bank would ever wanna hurdle over.
To assess and control the risk at hand, we devise a model to not only classify a customer as credible or not but to give the probability of default on payments too.

## Overview of the Dataset:
An important bank in Taiwan conducted a study back in the year 2005 whose targets were the credit card holders associated with that bank. Among 30,000 recorded observations, 6,636 card holders were found to have defaulted on their payments.
Attributes such as the customer's ID, Credit Limit, Gender, Education Level, Martial Status, Age were recorded.
Along with these attributes, those that concerned the repayment statuses, bill amount and payment amount for each month in 2 quarters of the year were also recorded. 
The final column in this dataset records the default status.
Our goal is to learn the intricacies involved in this dataset to approximate the patterns exhibited using an artificial neural network.
 

## Predicting what?
We employ an artificial neural network to predict the probability of default on credit card payments.

The dataset has been taken from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository website
